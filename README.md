Week 1 -> My First app
In the first week, we created a basic application understanding basics of android studio.

Description:
This app had two fragments. 
The First fragment has 3 buttons:
1. Toast: Displays a "Hello Toast" popup.
2. Count: Repeatedly, the count of "0" (on the opening screen) rises.
3.Random: Random will navigate to the Second fragment, which displays a random number between 0 and count.
